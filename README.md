# CS 126 Final Project - Professor Rating App

Welcome to my CS126 final project, Josh's Professor Rating App! 

### What is it?

Have you ever heard a professor is "harder" than another? That maybe a certain professor just hands out graders that are lower, on average? Or maybe that they're "easier" or a better instructor, and give higher grades than average. This is designed to give you a quick look at these statistics for any professor at UIUC from 2010 to 2017.

### How do I use it?

Installation and running instructions:

You must first have OpenFrameworks downloaded on your computer. If you don't have it, you can get it [here](http://openframeworks.cc/download/). Once you download it, make sure to add [OfxDatGui](https://braitsch.github.io/ofxDatGui/), following the instructions listed on that repo. Once you've done that, clone or download this project and then open up the OpenFrameworks "project generator". Update the clone of this repo on your computer via the project generator. 

To run the project, run `make` after `cd`ing into the directory, followed by `make RunRelease`.

To run the test suite, run `make testing` and then `./testing`.
