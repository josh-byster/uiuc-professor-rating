#### Introduction

I would like to propose a laundry viewing application for housing at Illinois. I recently found out that Illinois is switching over to a LaundryView application that is new and has not yet been deployed publicly (advertised) at this point.

The API is located [here](http://www.laundryview.com/housingillinois "here"). 

#### Frameworks Used

I would like to use some framework that enables parsing of XML data which is how the API conveys information. I'm proposing using Xerces-C++ XML Parser along with Libcurl or some similar framework to get data asynchronously. 

#### Background

I'm already a bit familiar with loading API data along with styling the design from making my UIUC Bus website. I also am familiar with asynchronous processes from coding apps for iOS.
